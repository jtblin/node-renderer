#node-renderer

Simple nodejs server to render templates from **json** using **Underscore**.

## Roadmap

1. Render index template from POST - done
2. Render user template from GET - done
3. More error handling?
4. More abstraction?

## Disclaimer

node-renderer was created to test rendering views with nodejs from a Rails backend. RoR view rendering have performance issues and I wanted to quickly benchmark whether it was faster to generate json from Rails and get nodejs to render the template and returns the html. It turns out it is much faster...
